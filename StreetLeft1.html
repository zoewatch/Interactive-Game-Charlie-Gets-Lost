<p> You search the parking lot. There are lots of cars. You search under them thinking Charlie might be hiding, all while calling out his name. You see people chatting and you see lots of other dogs, you ask several people if they saw a lab puppy running around.
They all say they haven't. Charlie doesn't seem to be here. So you decide to go back to the <a href="https://people.reed.edu/~zoewatch/FetchWaitKeepLookingDirection.html"> street </a>.</p>
