<p> You look for Lady. Charlie seems to know where Lady is, he keeps pulling you towards the street but you pass out. You wake up in a hospital a few hours later with Lady and Charlie sitting on you. Your partner found Lady. Lady had been lost for weeks and the owner is on their way to the hospital now. </p>
