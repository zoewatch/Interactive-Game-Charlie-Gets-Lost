<p> You have decided to protect yourself. You run away from the giant dog. Charlie looks at you with betrayed eyes. Charlie tries to follow you but the huge dog tears him up. Charlie dies. You start shouting at the huge dog and the dog chases you down.
Another huge dog appears that is exactly the same. Every marking is exactly the same. It is the same dog. But there are two of them. They run in unison at you. Then another one appears. There are three of these huge dogs all exactly the same. You can't continue to run, your legs won't let you. The dogs jump on top of you. They start mauling you and chewing your arms and legs and face.
They chew every part of you. They tear out your organs and wait until your heart can not beat any more as they wait for you to be relieved of your agony by death. The hell hounds tear out your heart as you draw your last miserable breath. You die.</p>
