<p> You walk to the right and start to smell something wonderful, it smells bread-y and sweet, and kind of like waffles, it fills your nostrils with goodness. You walk to see what the smell is, it's an ice cream truck and they are making waffle cones from scratch! You ask the ice cream woman if she saw any puppies around. She says she has, a small lab ran right in front of the truck a little while ago and ran off in the direction you just came from.
