<p> You see a white light and a voice. The voice asks you why you died. Why did you die? Why? Was it fate? Why? You cry out a deep cry that is heard throughout the depths of wherever the hell you have come. You cry and cry and say<a href="https://people.reed.edu/~zoewatch/AcrossStreetLive.html"> please let me live</a> or <a href="https://people.reed.edu/~zoewatch/AcrossStreetDie.html">please let me die</a>.</p>
